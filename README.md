In this study, the objective is to analyze previous year's student's data and use it to predict the placement chance of the current students. This project aims to provide students and placement cells with data-driven insights to enhance their chances of success in the campus placement process.
Additionally, the project can assist organizations in making informed decisions to improve their recruitment process based on past placement data.
This model is proposed with an algorithm to predict the same.
Data pertaining to the study were collected form the  same institution for which the placement prediction is done and also suitable data pre-processing methods were applied. 
This proposed model is also compared with other traditional classification algorithms such as classification and regression with respect to accuracy, precision and recall. 
From the results obtained it is found that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better in comparison with the other algorithms mentioned.
Here the algorithms used are logistic regression, naive bayes tree, random forest.
